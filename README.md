# Update-NS-on-NIC.MD
## It's personal automation project

The only scope of this project is to 
update glueDNS records at https://www.nic.md
for a domain name that is used for 
mail-in-a-box setup

It resolves the problem, that nic.md deletes this records daily.
The script can be run in headless mode by cron.
